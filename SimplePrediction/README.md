## Simple Prediction

Use k-nearest square and lease square method to classify low dimension datasets, the sets used are 2-dimensional data set with two distinc classifers. For the UCI data set, the classifer is either 4 or 2. 

## How to improve simple prediction from ESLII
<ol>
<li>Kernel methods use weights that decrease smoothly to zero with dis-
tance from the target point, rather than the effective 0/1 weights used
by k-nearest neighbors. </li>
<li>In high-dimensional spaces the distance kernels are modified to em-
phasize some variable more than others. </li>
<li>Local regression fits linear models by locally weighted least squares,
rather than fitting constants locally.</li>
</ol>

## Differences between two methods
Least square: low variance and potentially high bias.
Knn: high variance and low bias.
